## About this project
The tennis robot was created to address the tedious process of collecting tennis balls during practice sessions. It utilizes computer vision and OpenCV to navigate the tennis court and collect tennis balls. The robot is controlled using a Le Potato and Arduino, and is equipped with a Vector SPX and SIM motor. The robot also features a variety of 3D printed parts.

## Features

- Fully open source
- Collects tennis balls using computer vision (on a good day)
- Controlled using a Le Potato and Arduino Nano
- Equipped with a Vector SPX and SIM motor
- Uses a variety of 3D printed parts
- Effective


## Usage

The tennis robot is designed to make the process of collecting tennis balls during practice sessions easier and more efficient. It utilizes computer vision and OpenCV to navigate the tennis court and collect tennis balls. The robot is controlled using a Raspberry Pi and Arduino, and can be programmed using Python.

## Building robot

If you would want to recreate this project I would recomend contatcting me for help. Here is my process:
1. **[Parts List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WOlHqtKQNGEtz3eYZs2hdRVGtGDle8vXkZdsuuQPpVE/edit?usp=sharing)**
2. Start with 3D printing. All the bearing are putted in by hearing up plasic and pressing them in. I would not recomend doing that for hears because you could seat them inperfectly. You hould be able co cold press them with your hands. Also there is a hole for machine key on the motor gear but there is no reason to use becasue gear works just fine without it.
